The first industrial revolution began in the 1800s with mechanization of production and power generation.

The second industrial revolution came along at the beginning of the 20th century with the electrification of cities, which enabled industrialization and mass production.

The third industrial revolution arrived in the 1960s and is characterized by digitalization and automation. This allowed factories to have flexible production lines, enabling the manufacture of different products using programmable machines.

Today we’re in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution. The technology that is fueling this change is smart automation, advanced connectivity and decentralized control (IoT). The consequence: the reorganization of the classic production process in which the whole system is now monitored and decisions are made in a decentralized way in real time. The products being made in such factory are also “smart”. Using RFID chips, they can be tracked and they can monitor their own state through the whole life cycle, including during their lifetime and application.

The advantages of this paradigm are many. According to some sources [2] Industry 4.0 could decrease production costs by 10-30%, logistic costs by 10-30% and quality management costs by 10-20%. It should also have other advantages such as a shorter time to market for new products, improved costumer responsiveness, custom mass production without significant increase in costs, more flexible and friendlier working environments and more efficient use of natural resources and energy.

It is these last two points that are of interest to me. There’s no denying that businesses who can point to their good environmental and worker environments use it to improve their public image and even drive sales, as is the case of, for example, Patagonia, Inc. These companies use a combination of environmental accounting, which measures and brings into monetary terms the effect of a company’s activities on the environment, and external accreditations such as the b-corporation certification in an attempt to communicate and extract value from their environmental efforts.

What these practices lack is real time accountability. Lack of timely and accurate data undermines the credibility of these efforts and it can lead to accusations of green-washing. For example, getting certified as a b-corporation requires an in depth audit, meaning that only a handful of companies get certified per year, and some certifications are already some years old.

With real time measurements using Internet connected sensors, their goals could be monitored in real time, and their impact on the environment more accurately measured in a way that requires less trust in centralized agencies. Distributed sensors (IoT) and a free and secure data highway could make this a reality.
