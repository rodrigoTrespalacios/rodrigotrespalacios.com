While the word "sustainable" is well known it's definition is ambiguous and thus meaningless. The earliest instance of the term in it's current connotation is found in [The Limits to Growth](http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Limits-to-Growth-digital-scan-version.pdf) (1976), a study of the earth’s carrying capacity in relation to the population explosion:

> “It is possible to alter these growth trends and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future, the state of global equilibrium could be designed so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential.”

However, the most cited definition of sustainability comes from the Brundtland Report, [Our Common Future](http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf) (1987):

> “Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”

Since then, the word has been used, hijacked and twisted to suit government and business who realized the word resonated with people, but that really just wanted to continue with business as usual. As a result, although the term is extremely familiar, it has become green-washed, it's meaning lost or taking on negative associations.

However, sustainability isn't a trend, it's an ethic, how could the idea of humanity flourishing forever suddenly go out of fashion? 

Those who champion the idea have moved on, finding new ways - and new words - to inspire change. For instance, in the business and investor worlds, "sustainability" has morphed and expanded to measure three distinct categories: environmental, social and governance. Known as ESG criteria, they are, according to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp), "a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments".

Environmental criteria include things such as carbon and green house gas emissions, water usage, waste disposal, etc. Social criteria include diversity, labor relations, community relations, etc. Governance criteria deals with transparency, board composition, executive pay, audits, shareholder rights and more.

ESG scores are increasingly used, particularly by young investors, to put their money where their values are. ESG scores allow investors to quickly assess how well a company is run and how close they match their values. No single company may pass every test in every category, of course, so investors need to decide what's most important to them. For example, investors can exclude companies  with major recent or ongoing controversies related to workplace discrimination, corporate governance, and animal welfare, among other things.

How are these criteria measured? ESG scores are usually assigned by third party ESG rating firms such as [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/), [Institutional Shareholder Services](https://www.issgovernance.com/), and [MSCI](https://www.msci.com/). Companies are, in most cases, automatically rated based on the information they disclose publicly in the three ESG categories. The ESG score is highly dependent on how much a company discloses about itself, transparency being an important factor in good governance. This information is then sold to companies such as Bloomberg, who provide it as part of their trading terminal product. 

### The Future


We are of the opinion that this information should be used by the average consumer to make purchasing decisions. However, to make it available in an easy to understand and easy to use way is a big challenge. This is what we are trying to do at [Proveit](https://proveit.io).
