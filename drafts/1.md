Why did I start this blog? 

As part of a new personal project I'm working on and my current job at [Wevolver](https://wevolver.com), I need to do a lot of research. Somewhere along the way, I realized that all that knowledge was being used once and then thrown away. With that in mind, and inspired by one of my colleagues Ben, I decided to summarize the topics I research here for three main purposes: to understand the topics more deeply, to record the conclusions for later reference, and to improve my online presence.


For that I needed a way to program my blog that allowed me to control every aspect of it, was easy to develop and that didn't need a server. The answer to all of those requirements was Next.js. Next.js is a framework for developing server side rendered (SSR) react applications. With over 31,000 stars on GitHub, Next.js allows you to create SSR apps with automatic code splitting, filesystem based routing and the possibility to add markdown based post with very minimal setup. For that I used the a framework built on top of Next.js called Nextein, a static website generator based on markdown.

The generated site is deployed as a serveless static website using [zeit's](https://zeit.co) Now service.
